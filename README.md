# Up and Running with WP-CLI

Traditionally, interacting with WordPress is largely a graphical affair: many users rely on WP Admin to manage themes, plugins, content, and everything else. For situations where you need to be able to script WordPress interactions, however, nothing compares to the power of WP-CLI, the official command line interface for WordPress.

This session acts as a primer for WP-CLI, scratching the surface of what can be done and how it fits into the WordPress workflow. Whether you’ve never heard of WP-CLI or have been using it as part of your daily WordPress rituals, you’re sure to learn at least a few useful tricks.
